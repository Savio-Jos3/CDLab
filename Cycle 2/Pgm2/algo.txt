Initialization: The program starts, prints "Enter" to prompt the user for input, and then starts the Lex/Flex scanner (yylex).

Start Scanning: The yylex function begins reading characters from the input.

Rule Matching: The scanner attempts to match the input against its rules for each line (because both rules end with \n). Lex always prioritizes the first rule that matches.

Rule 1 (.*"Savio".*\n):

It first checks: Does the current line contain the substring "Savio" anywhere within it?

If YES, this rule matches the entire line.

Action: The program prints the message "This string contains 'Savio':" followed by the entire line of text that was just read.

Rule 2 (.*\n):

If NO (the line does not contain "Savio"), Rule 1 fails. The scanner then tries the next rule.

This rule matches any line of text (any character . repeated * times, followed by a newline \n).

Action: The program simply prints the entire line of text it just read (echoing it).

Loop or End:

The program repeats Step 3 for every new line of input.

When the user signals the end of input (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+D), the yylex function finishes.

The main function returns 0, and the program exits.
